Quake 2 Mod:

This is my Game Mod project for Quake 2, internally called 'Quake 2: Special Forces'. It introduces elements such as new powerups, and an XP-based system which allows you to multiply your damage through weapons XP.

Different guns can carry XP. You need to damage enemies with a gun to get XP for that gun. For every 10 XP you gain, the damage of the gun increases - allowing you to kill enemies quicker.
An example: shooting an enemy with the blaster gives you +1XP. getting 10 XP with your blaster gives you double damage, while getting 20XP gives you triple damage, and so on. If you are hurt by an enemy, you loose all your levels (save powerups)

(Each item's internal name is given in quotations)

There are 5 different one-use pickup items:
* XP Upgrade 1: "XP1" - upgrades your max XP from 30 to 40
* XP Upgrade 2: "XP2" - upgrades your max XP from 40 to 50
* Adderol: "Adderol" Makes machinegun recoin nonexistent
* Health pickups give you +1XP each
* Adrenaline pickups give you +10XP each

There are 5 different one-use powerups:
* The Seal: "The Seal" - prevents you from loosing any XP
* Lightsuit: "Lightsuit" - gives you a lantern which lasts for a few seconds
* Standard Armor: "Standard Issue" - doubles your damage for as long as you have cells
* Unlimited Ammo: "Unlimited Ammo" - you do not consume any ammo you have for the duration of the powerup
* Jetpack: "Shitty Jetpack" - jetpack for 40 seconds
